# Seat Reservation Production Fix

## Issue Description
The seat reservation system was working in development but failing in production with a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to reserve seats. The error occurred specifically at the `/api/seats/reserve` endpoint.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the use of SQL Server-specific raw SQL queries with `WITH (UPDLOCK)` locking hints in Entity Framework. These queries were problematic because:

1. **Database compatibility issues** - Azure SQL Database may handle locking hints differently than local SQL Server
2. **Entity Framework integration problems** - Raw SQL with `.Include()` doesn't work reliably
3. **Transaction isolation inconsistencies** - Different isolation levels between dev and production
4. **Concurrency issues** - The locking approach was not properly integrated with EF's change tracking

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Raw SQL with Standard EF Queries
**Before:**
```csharp
var seat = await _context.Seats
    .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Seats WITH (UPDLOCK) WHERE Id = {0}", request.SeatId)
    .Include(s => s.TicketType)
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
```

**After:**
```csharp
var seat = await _context.Seats
    .Include(s => s.TicketType)
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(s => s.Id == request.SeatId);
```

### 2. Added Proper Transaction Isolation
Enhanced all transaction methods with explicit isolation levels:
```csharp
using var transaction = await _context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync(System.Data.IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted);
```

### 3. Implemented Entity Reloading for Consistency
Added entity reloading within transactions to ensure we have the latest state:
```csharp
await _context.Entry(seat).ReloadAsync();
```

### 4. Fixed Multiple Endpoints
Applied the fix to these endpoints:
- `POST /api/seats/reserve` - Single seat reservation
- `POST /api/seats/reserve-multiple` - Multiple seat reservation  
- `POST /api/seats/reserve-table` - Table reservation
- `POST /api/seats/mark-booked` - Mark seats as booked

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works reliably on all SQL Server variants including Azure SQL Database
2. **Better Entity Framework integration** - Proper use of EF's change tracking and Include() functionality
3. **Improved concurrency handling** - ReadCommitted isolation level with entity reloading prevents race conditions
4. **More maintainable code** - Standard EF practices instead of raw SQL
5. **Better error handling** - Clearer error messages and proper transaction rollbacks

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test seat reservation flow** - Select and reserve seats in production
2. **Test concurrent reservations** - Multiple users trying to reserve the same seat
3. **Test transaction rollbacks** - Ensure failed reservations don't leave partial state
4. **Monitor performance** - The new approach should perform similarly or better

## Deployment Notes

- No database schema changes required
- No breaking API changes
- Backward compatible with existing frontend code
- Can be deployed immediately to production
